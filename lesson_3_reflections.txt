When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    - When working on public projec or more than 1 person is working on same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository
    - Because if someone else is working on same repo we dont want these changes to be in our computer until we want it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    - Forks - To fork someone's else repo and contribute to it, while he can be recognized as the main person of the project.
                It create clone on github server.
    - Clones - Clone helps to clone someone else or own repository in our local system or repo.
    - Branches - Branch help us to do experiment or to separate our code from original code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    - We can resolve and look into issues without having internet connections which we are going to face when 
      we have to commit pur changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    - Without github we have to send entire zip version of file to another system, It will be so hard to track changes that someone had made and the history of changes too.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
    - Separate branch helps us to keep the actual working code and we can experiment on new feature in separate branch.
    - Master branch can be updated to reduce the extra work which we need to do when we are working on different branch.
