When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    - When working on public projec or more than 1 person is working on same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository
    - Because if someone else is working on same repo we dont want these changes to be in our computer until we want it.
