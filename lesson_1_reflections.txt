How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    - sign shows what is in the old line, + sign show what is in the new file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    we can know what changes we had made in each commit.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros -> We create a commit according to our understanding whenever we made a effective change.
    Cons -> we manually have to make all these commits and it's hard to decide when to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files may be dependent so we can track those changes of all files in single commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see commit's id then git commit id1 id2 for seeing the diferene between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Now I can experiment more because I can go back to commit where my code is working correctly.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for keeping track of versions of my file
